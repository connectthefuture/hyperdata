<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed myself making <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eGcsGPgUTw">Get Your Data Out!</a> back
in 2008 (how time flies) and recently wanted to apply myself to some fun
projects to keep the black dog at bay. So I've made another geek-pop advocacy
video called:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Can I Hack It?</p>

<p><em>a little celebration of Open Source</em></p>

<p></p>

<p>It's a <strong>public information broadcast</strong>, just under 4 minutes
long, briefly describing what open source is, why it should be encouraged, an
overview of the best-known licenses and introducing a bunch of open source
applications. With a <strong>bouncy soundtrack</strong> to help stop you
getting bored.</p>

<p>All the source and media files I used are <a href="#Source">here</a>. Please
<strong>feel free to rebroadcast, remix, etc. </strong></p>

<p>(Creative Commons Attribution License)<strong></strong></p>

<p>I personally believe Open Source is very important and anything that
encourages it should in turn be encouraged, so I'll be grateful for any links
on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus etc.</p>

<p></p>

<h2><a id="Made">How it was Made</a></h2>

<h3>Audio</h3>

<p>I'm afraid the audio wasn't recorded on open source software. For historical
reasons* I used the <a href="http://www.energy-xt.com/">EnergyXT</a> (€59) on
MS Windows. It's a <strong>fairly standard multitrack recording</strong>
application, similar to those mentioned below. (*I had soundcard issues when I
first set up my audio workstation, to save time I installed MS Windows and used
the manufacturer's drivers). But I also used various (free) VST plugins for
processing with EnergyXT as host, plus <a
href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> for preprocessing
samples.</p>

<p>The audio hardware included a <strong>fairly standard (Frankenstein) desktop
PC</strong> with <a
href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Delta66.html">Delta 66</a>
soundcard (4-channel input, 4-channel output, <a
href="http://www.thomann.de/gb/m-audio_delta_66.htm">€195</a>), plus a
<strong>tambourine</strong> and all the other bits and pieces in <a
href="http://dannyayers.com/stuff/studio">my home studio</a>.</p>

<p>For mixdown I usually play stuff into a little <a
href="http://www.thomann.de/gb/zoom_h2.htm">Zoom H2</a> recorder. It doesn't
seem to impact the quality perceptibly, and it's very convenient, I just send
it what would be going to the speakers from the mixer.</p>

<p>Final tweaks and conversion to mp3 I did with the <em>essential</em> <a
href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> (with <a
href="http://lame.sourceforge.net/">lame</a> installed).</p>

<h3>Video</h3>

<p>The visuals were put together using <strong>entirely open source
software</strong> on my laptop running <a
href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. </p>

<p>Although the idea is simple enough, it took me a long time to find the tools
that I needed. Video formats are a total nightmare, finding an approach that
would produce something that kept the sync and was suitable for YouTube took
ages.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it's basically a slide show presentation, so I started with <a
href="http://www.libreoffice.org/features/impress/">LibreOffice Impress</a>. To
hold the same slide over several bars of music it's simply repeated in the
slide deck. The only problem with that is I needed 500+ slides. Lots of copy
&amp; paste (and I'm afraid LibreOffice gets a little bit crashy with that many
slides).</p>

<p>Quite a lot of Web searching was also involved to find all the logos etc,
but I don't like to moan... Once the slides were assembled I did <strong>export
as html</strong>, which actually produces an image for each slide plus some
minimal HTML to tie them together (the XHTML export has the slide text as
content). I exported 800x600 PNGs, an option for which I think I needed to
install docvert.</p>

<p>From there I did a bunch of pre-processing using quick &amp; dirty
scripts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="src/process.sh">process.sh</a> - glue for the other scripts
    (this shows the sequence of operations)</li>
  <li><a href="src/rename.py">rename.py</a> - renames the image files so
    they'll load in correct order</li>
  <li><a href="src/resize.sh">resize.sh</a> - resizes the images to 640x480</li>
</ul>

<p>After a lot of failed attempts with combinations of imagemagick, mencoder
and ffmpeg etc. on the command-line, I managed to get the desired result using
<a href="http://lives.sourceforge.net/">LiVES</a>, a powerful video editor/VJ
tool.</p>

<p>Also useful was <a
href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/mediainfo">mediainfo</a>, which will
tell you the format details of an existing media file.</p>

<p>The music is <strong>140bpm</strong>, so I used an initial frame rate of
2.3333333 fps, with slides I wanted to show for more than one beat simply
repeated. Afterwards I changed the fps in LiVES to 25fps, added the soundtrack
and exported.</p>

<p>Of course I had to repeat this procedure a lot of times to get the sync
right and correct mistakes. But I don't like to moan. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> was used for authoring this
document.</p>

<h2><a id="Source">Source Files</a></h2>

<p>Here is the initial <a href="rough-links.html">set of links</a> I used when
compiling the slides, afraid I was too impatient when it came to the individual
products to bookmark them.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Slides :</strong> odt, ppt, images</li>
  <li>mp3 320kHz</li>
  <li>mp3 128kHz</li>
  <li>wav</li>
  <li>audio without voices</li>
  <li>stems</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Let me know if you do a remix and I'll link to it from here.</em></p>

<h2><a id="Competition">Competition</a></h2>

<p>The soundtrack features 3 sample snippets (duration of each: ) taken from
elsewhere. (Given that the video is about the remixing of information these are
included for educational purposes, i.e. covered by fair use. IANAL, YMMV). I'll
think of a little token prize for the first person to correctly identify the
sources (without analysing the stems!), mail me.</p>
