<h1>Elda</h1>
<h2>An implementation of the Linked Data API</h2>
</div>

<p>
This document is a quick-start for the 
<a href="http://www.epimorphics.com">Epimorphics Ltd</a>
implementation, Elda, of the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/linked-data-api/wiki/Specification">Linked Data API</a>.
The Elda runnable-demo jar can be downloaded from its Googlecode 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/elda/downloads/list">downloads page</a>;
pick the latest unless you have good reason not to.  
</p>

<p>
    A <a href="advanced.html">separate document</a> describes
    some of Elda's additional configuration options.
</p>

<p>
If you want to explore the Elda codebase and have
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>
installed, you can download the Elda repository:

<pre>
hg clone https://elda.googlecode.com/hg/ elda  
</pre>

<p>
In the rest of this document, "the Elda jar" means the 
downloaded standalone demonstration jar.
</p>

</p>

<h3>What is the LDA?</h3>

<p>
The Linked Data API provides a configurable way to access RDF data
using simple RESTful URLs that are translated into queries to
a SPARQL endpoint. The API developer (probably you) writes an
API spec (in RDF) which specifies how to translate URLs into
queries. Elda comes with some pre-built examples which allow
you to experiment with the style of query and get started with
building your own specs.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>Elda is written in Java 
(using the <a href="http://openjena.org/">Jena RDF toolkit</a>),
so you will need Java installed on your system.
</p>

<p>
The default demonstration setup for Elda uses the 
<code>data.gov.uk</code>
data accessible from the SPARQL endpoint 
<code>http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql</code>.
To run the demonstration, you will need to have open
web access.
</p>

<h3>Caveat</h3>

<p>
This is a release of Elda to get feedback from the community.
Some features of the LDA have not yet been implemented, or are not
completely implemented &ndash; see 
<a href="#implementation-state">the implementation state</a>. 
We welcome feedback; please use the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linked-data-api-discuss">
linked data API discussion group
</a> google-group (note: you will need a google account to 
use this group).

</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>
The Elda code is shipped as a single self-unpacking jar, 
<code>elda-VERSION.jar</code>. You can start it from the command line:

<pre>
java -jar elda-VERSION.jar
</pre>

or, if your system permits, by double-clicking on it in
your preferred file browser.
</p>

<p>
In either case, Elda unzips itself from that jar into a
new directory, Elda_VERSION, from which it starts
itself as a Jetty server running on port 8080.
</p>

<p>
You should now be able to browse to LDA URIs:

<pre>
<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.json">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.json</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.html">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.html</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?label=Hope+Primary+School">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?label=Hope+Primary+School</a>

<a href="http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?max-schoolCapacity=100">http://localhost:8080/elda/api/education/schools.xml?max-schoolCapacity=100</a>
</pre>

and see presentations of selected schools' data. The html rendering
(which is provided by an XSLT transform of the xml rendering)
has many interesting features.
</p>

<p>
Once Elda has unzipped itself, you can run it from the Elda
directory it creates:

<pre>
(in Elda_VERSION)

java -jar start.jar
</pre>

(Or by double-clicking, etc).
</p>

<h2>If you can't use port 8080</h2>

<p>
You may already be using port 8080 for some local service.
In that case, you can start Elda from the command
line (no double-click) with

<pre>
java -jar elda.jar -Djetty.port=NNNN
</pre>

or, if you're starting from the unzipped Elda directory,

<pre>
java -Djetty.port=NNNN -jar start.jar
</pre>

where NNNN is the port of your choice. (Yes, the -D
comes after elda.jar, but before start.jar.)
</p>

<p>
To change the port number without having to
supply a <code>-Djetty.port</code> command line option
every time, in the Elda directory edit the
configuration file <code>etc/jetty.xml</code>
and change the line:

<pre>
&lt;Set name="port"&gt;&lt;SystemProperty name="jetty.port" <b>default="8080"</b>/&gt;&lt;/Set&gt;
</pre>

to:

<pre>
&lt;Set name="port"&gt;&lt;SystemProperty name="jetty.port" <b>default="NNNN"</b>/&gt;&lt;/Set&gt;
</pre>
where NNNN is the port number of your choice.
</p>

<h2>Using other LDA specifications</h2>

<p>
</p>

<h3>From the command line</h3>

<p>
To use different LDA specifications, use the system property 
<code>elda.spec</code>. Like the port number, it can be set
as part of launching the elda jar or when launching the jetty
start jar:

<pre>
java -jar elda.jar -Delda.spec=SPECS
</pre>

or (in the Elda directory):

<pre>
java -Delda.spec=SPECS -jar start.jar
</pre>

where SPECS is one or more LDA specification files separated
by commas.
</p>

<p>
If you use <code>elda.spec</code>, then Elda ignores the 
default specification (the education LDA) wired into it.
</p>

<h3>By editing web.xml</h3>

<p>
To change the specification used without having to use
a <code>-Delda.spec</code> command line option every time, edit the
Elda <code>webapps/elda/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>. Find the
servlet configuration

<pre>
&lt;servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-name&gt;loader-init&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
  &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.epimorphics.lda.routing.Loader&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;com.epimorphics.api.initialSpecFile&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;<b>specs/education.ttl</b>&lt;/param-value&gt;
  &lt;/init-param&gt;
  &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;
</pre>

Replace <b>specs/education.ttl</b> with the name of the LDA
specification files you wish to load, separated by commas. 
</p>

<h2>Querying a local file</h2>

<p>
If the remote SPARQL endpoint is slow, not yet fully configured,
or plain unimplemented, you might want to set up a local endpoint
using a tool like 
<a href="http://openjena.org/wiki/Fuseki">Fuseki</a>. But it's also
possible for Elda to query a local RDF file. 
</p>

<p>
Edit your spec file, which will look something like the
education spec suplied with Elda:

<pre>
spec:api
  a api:API ;
  rdfs:label "Edubase API"@en;
  api:maxPageSize "50";
  api:defaultPageSize "10" ;
  <b>api:sparqlEndpoint &lt;http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql&gt;</b> ;
  api:endpoint 
   spec:schools
   , spec:schoolsPrimary
   , spec:schoolsSecondary
   , spec:schoolsPrimaryDistrict
   , spec:schoolsSecondaryDistrict 
 .
</pre>

Replace the services URI with <b>local:file-name</b>, 
where <b>file-name</b> is the name of the RDF file you 
wish to query. (It's safest to make this an absolute
filename.) When Elda issues queries to a local: file, 
it loads (and remembers) the file contents and queries those.
</p>

<h2>Using a local TDB datasource</h2>

<p>
As an alternative to setting up a local SPARQL endpoint, 
or using a local: file, you can instead use a local
<a href="http://openjena.org/wiki/TDB">Jena TDB</a>
database. To do so you will need to modify the <code>web.xml</code>
webapp configuration file and supply an additional init-param
for the <code>loader-init</code> servlet. You can do this in
two ways:
<p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param>
  &lt;param-name>com.epimorphics.api.TDB-base-directory&lt;/param-name>
  &lt;param-value><b>tdb-directory</b>&lt;/param-value>
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Replace <b>tdb-directory</b> with the path to
your chosen TDB directory. Note that the path is relative to the
webapps directory &ndash; your best choice is to use an absolute path.
</p>

<p>
<i>Warning</i>. If the directory does not contain any TDB files,
TDB will create a new empty dataset in it. This is usually not
what you want, since all queries will return no answers, so
Elda will report an error during setup.
</p>

<p>
The alternative form:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;init-param>
  &lt;param-name>com.epimorphics.api.dataStoreDirectory&lt;/param-name>
  &lt;param-value><b>datastore-directory</b>&lt;/param-value>
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</pre>

<p>
specifies <b>datastore-directory</b> as a directory containing a
TDB directory named <i>tdb</i>. The same warnings as above apply. 
(This form exists because Elda can do limited LARQ indexing and
in that case the datastore directory will have a <b>larq</b>
subdirectory for the LARQ indexes.)
</p>

<p>
Having specified a TDB directory, you can now edit your spec's
sparqlEndpoint declaration, which in the education example looks
like:

<pre>
spec:api
  a api:API ;
  rdfs:label "Edubase API"@en;
  api:maxPageSize "50";
  api:defaultPageSize "10" ;
  <b>api:sparqlEndpoint &lt;http://services.data.gov.uk/education/sparql&gt;</b> ;
  api:endpoint 
   spec:schools
   , spec:schoolsPrimary
   , spec:schoolsSecondary
   , spec:schoolsPrimaryDistrict
   , spec:schoolsSecondaryDistrict 
 .
</pre>

Replace the services URI with <b>tdb:model-name</b>, where <b>model-name</b>
is the name of your endpoint model inside the TDB store.

</p>

<h2>Using Elda as a webapp</h2>

<p>
The Elda shipped jar is just a delivery mechanism for getting
started with LDA functionality. Elda itself is just a webapp
which the jar bundles with Jetty.
</p>

<p>
To use Elda in your own webapps, you can copy the constructed
Elda webapp from the unzipped Elda-VERSION/webapps/elda directory
and edit its web.xml as you require. The necessary jars are all
in <code>webapps/elda/WEB-INF/lib</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you have downloaded the Elda repository, then you can
rebuild the Elda working jars 
(json-rdf-VERSION.jar and lda-VERSION.jar) 
and webapp using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>. 
</p>

<p>
The demo jar is given the name <i>elda-standalone-VERSION.jar</i>
by the "mvn install" process.
</p>

<h2>Using Elda directly</h2>

<p>You don't need to go through a servlet (or restlet)
framework to exploit Elda. You can call the components
yourself and supply whatever glue you like.
</p>

<h3>Creating an APISpec</h3>

<p>
The constructor
<pre>
APISpec(Resource config, ModelLoaderI forVocab)
</pre>

delivers a new APISpec object configured from the given
Resource. You may have chosen a Resource with a known 
URI in a config model, or found one with <code>rdf:type</code>
<code>api:API</code>, depending on your usecase. The
<code>ModelLoaderI</code> is only used if the config has
<code>api:vocabulary</code> elements, in which case it
loads a model for its API vocabulary.
</p>

<p>
Given an APISpec, the method <code>getEndpoints()</code>
delivers a list of <code>APIEndpoint</code> objects corresponding
(in no defined order) with the endpoint descriptions in the
config model. 
</p>

<h3>Running an endpoint</h3>

<p>
You can then invoke
<pre>
APIEndpointUtil.call( match, requestUri, queryParams )
</pre>

to have the endpoint handle a "request" from the given
<code>requestURI</code> with the given <code>queryParams</code>.
The <code>match</code> wraps the endpoint itself and any
variable bindings that have been made by matching the
endpoint's UriTemplate against the request URI.
</p>

<p>
The call returns a three-element object which contains the
<code>ResultSet</code> of the query execution (the result
model and selected items), the name of the result formatter
that has been selected by the endpoint, and the CallContext
variable bindings.
</p>

<h3>Rendering results</h3>

<p>
Once you have chosen a renderer <code>R</code> to use for the 
result set, the invocation

<pre>
R.render( rc, results )
</pre>

delivers a String which is the rendering of <code>results</code>
according to the RenderContext <code>rc</code>, which you can
construct from the <code>VarValues</code> embedded in the call
context, the context path, and an AsURL object to convert URI
fragments into full URIs.
</p>

<p>
The method call <code>R.getMediaType()</code> returns the media
type for the renderer's result. 
</p>

<h2>Formatting extensions</h2>

<p>
If the object of an <code>api:stylesheet</code> directive starts
with the prefix "xsl:", then the stylesheet is loaded from Elda's
stylesheet directory, wherever that is. (By default it is 
<code>webapp/xsltsheets</code>, but this will become configurable.)
</p>

<p>
If a formatter has the property 
<code>http://www.epimorphics.com/vocabularies/lda#className</code>,
then the (String) object of that property must be the name of a Java
class that implements the <code>RendererFactory</code> interface.
When rendering is required, an instance of that class is invoked
to deliver a Renderer, and that Renderer is used to render the
result set.
</p>

<h2><a name="implementation-state">State of the implementation</a></h2>

<p>
Elda aims to provide a complete implementation of the Linked Data API,
but the following minor features are not currently provided.
Future releases will include them. Problems with Elda should 
be reported to the 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linked-data-api-discuss">
linked data API discussion group
</a>. Current issues can be seen on the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/elda/issues/list">
Elda issues list
</a>.
</p>

<h3>Formatting</h3>

<p>
Not all of the detailed language-tag and literal-type features
work as specified.
</p>

<h3>Cache</h3>

<p>
Elda caches the results of queries so that they may be re-served
quickly. When the cache gets "too full", it is reset. "Too full"
by default is measured by the number of triples in the cache.
See the more detailed documentation how to control the cache.
