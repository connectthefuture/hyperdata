Slide : Danny Ayers, danny.ayers@gmail.com

Voice : Good morning, Hello, Hi, Hulloo, ciao. I'm Danny. I code, I do some tech writing, I do consulting stuff.
Please stop me if I'm not speaking clearly, but if I get this right there will be time for questions at the end. There isn't much time, but I've already got several significant features of Web Architecture in, along with a load of semantics.
I introduced myself as a Danny, but I'm also Danny Ayers and I'm also danny.ayers@gmail.com
Same thing, lots of names.
