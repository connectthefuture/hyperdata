- Sergey Brin, around 2002
  - "Look, putting angle brackets around things is not a technology, by itself. I'd rather make progress by having computers understand what humans write, than by forcing humans to write in ways computers can understand."

- Linked Data
  - component parts of statements can be treated as links. 
  - each statement can be considered a (typed) link :
  - subject --property--> object

- Linked Open Data 5 Stars
  - ★ make your stuff available on the Web (whatever format) under an open license
  - ★★	make it available as structured data (e.g., Excel instead of image scan of a table)
  - ★★★ use non-proprietary formats (e.g., CSV instead of Excel)
  - ★★★★ use URIs to identify things, so that people can point at your stuff
  - ★★★★★ link your data to other data to provide context

- The Big Intuition 
  - A Semantic Web-friendly application costs no more to develop than a traditional one
  - Short term : increased surface area, good for SEO
  - Longer term : easy reuse
- Blue Oceans
  - no two companies are offering the same product or service
  - capturing new demand rather than competing for existing market-share
  - innovation!
