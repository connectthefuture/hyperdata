<h1>Web Beeps</h1>

<p>On the 31st December 2011, while everyone else was out celebrating, I
switched on a service at <a href="http://webbeep.it">http://webbeep.it</a>.
From the site blurb:</p>

<p><strong>Web Beeps are short, quasi-musical sounds which encode text. They
can be thought of as sonic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR
Codes</a>. You can use them to create audio representation of Web links and
identify things with tones. They are easy to <a href="#Make">create</a>, <a
href="#Decode">decode</a> and <a href="implementation.html">use</a> and backed
by an <a href="spec.html">open specification</a> together with an <a
href="https://github.com/danja/WebBeep">open source implementation</a>.
</strong></p>

<p>The project started as an experiment to see if it could be done, and from
that perspective the project is effectively finished, goal achieved. </p>
