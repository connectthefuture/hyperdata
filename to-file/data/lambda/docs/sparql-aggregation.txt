ARQ runs in standards mode (SPARQL 1.1) by default:

SELECT (count(*) AS ?C) { ?s ?p ?o }

Older style,

SELECT count(*) { ?s ?p ?o }

will work if you choose syntaxARQ (which is ticking "SPARQL extended syntax" in the validator [1] or the same service in the Fuseki download.

ARQ supports all the SPARQl 1.1 aggregates [2]
COUNT, SUM, MIN, MAX, AVG, GROUP_CONCAT, and SAMPLE.
